      <p>Be it movies where the hackers try to decrypt the password to steal those million dollars or a treasure hunt where you are supposed to solve the last clue to find the treasure, cryptography is present everywhere. But do you know what it actually is or how you can crack it or how you can create your own encryption systems.</p>

<p>If not, do not worry this series is all about that, we are going to look at different ciphers, perform cryptanalysis on them, see how difficult they are, how you can brute-force them and much more.</p>

<p>You can have a look at the above Tree Structure to get a basic understanding of the topic. Not all methods are presented in the above chart but some basic methods.</p>

<p>But before going any further into the series. Some of the terms mentioned above, if not all, might seem a bit foreign to you so let's start by learning all of those fancy terms.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>
<hr>

<h3><span>Plain Text</span></h3>

<p>An intelligible human readable text.</p>

<h3>Cryptography</h3>

<p>Cryptography is the field concerned with the art / study of secret communication, using cryptography we can convert any message into a un-intelligible secret message and convert any un-intelligible secret message to plain text.</p>

<h3>Cryptoanalysis</h3>

<p>Cryptoanalysis is the study of obtaining the original message from the secret message, without having any knowledge of the system used to convert the original message to the secret message.</p>

<h3>Cryptology</h3>

<p>Cryptology is focused more on the mathematical aspects of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis.</p>

<h3>Encryption</h3>

<p>The process of converting plain text to secret message using some rules / steps (also called as algorithms).</p>

<h3>Decryption</h3>

<p>The process of converting the secret message to original message using the reverse of the encryption algorithm.</p>

<h3>Cipher Text</h3>

<p>The secret message produced by encryption of original message.</p>

<h3>Key</h3>

<p>Keys are strings of characters, a message can be encrypted and decrypted on the basis of a key.</p>

<p>Imagine it like this, you completed a jigsaw puzzle containing extremely important information and you remove a piece of it so that the jigsaw puzzle does not make any sense for someone else except for the person having the exact similar piece. That piece here is the key.</p>

<h4>Symmetric Key</h4>

<p>Symmetric encryption is a system where one can encrypt and decrypt the information using the same key.</p>

<h4>Asymmetric Key</h4>

<p>Asymmetric encryption is a system where the key is split into two different keys as follows:</p>

<p>Public Key : This key is used to encrypt the information.
Private Key : This key is used to decrypt the information encrypted by the public key related to it.
The public key and the private key are not just two separately generated keys, but the two keys mathematically relate to each other such that the information encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted using private key related to the public key.</p>

<p>So, for a cipher there can be many public key but a single private key.</p>

<p>Imagine it like this, on internet many clients can send information, encrypted using public key, to the server and only the server meant to intercept can decrypt the information using the private key, anyone else intercepting the traffic would not be able to decrypt the information since they do not have the private key related to that public key.</p>

<p>You can also interchange the roles of the keys that is :</p>

<p>Public Key : You can use this key to decrypt the information.
Private Key : You can use this key to encrypt the information.
Imagine it like this, a server is going to send you a very confidential document so that you can review it. An opposition party does not want you to review the document, so the opposition party too sends a document to you. But now the question is how do you know which of the two is the original one.</p>

<p>This is where the above key roles can be used.</p>

<p>The server can encrypt the data using the private key, since the public and private keys are available in pairs only public keys relating to that private key can decrypt the encrypted information. So you using the public key can decrypt it. If you successfully decrypt it, it means that it's the original document.</p>

<p>You can be confident that it is the original document, the reason for that is we know only one private and related public keys can participate in this encryption / decryption and since you can successfully decrypt the data, the document is indeed sent by the official server.</p>

<h3>Stream Cipher</h3>

<p>Stream Cipher is a system where the plain text is encrypted to cipher text bit by bit (to keep it simple understand it as character by character) using a key.</p>

<h3>Block Cipher</h3>

<p>Block Cipher is a system where the plain text is encrypted to cipher text chunk by chunk.</p>

<p>We take a fixed amount of bits ( or a fixed amount of characters ) and encrypt them to blocks of cipher text using key.</p>

<h3>Steganography</h3>

<p>Steganography is the field of hiding secret message( encrypted or non-encrypted ) inside another file.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr>

<p>That is enough with the introduction of the series. These are some of the important basic terms that are enough to get you started with this Cryptography series. Any other terms / concepts will be introduced on the spot.</p>

<p>We are also going to implement the cryptographic algorithms using programming language : c++ in the further episodes.</p>

<p>Adios!!</p>
